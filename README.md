# PlantDiseaseDetectionApp (CS-F266 SOP, Supervisor - [Prof. Sundaresan Raman](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sundaresanraman/profile))

NOTE:- Code for ML model (Tensorflow on AlexNet) is given [here](https://github.com/vermasrijan/Plant_Disease_Detection_ML_Python) .<br/>

Plant Disease Detection using ML model and Android App .
CropTec_Ver1.0 is an Android Application which is used for detecting crop diseases using images of crop plants .

After pressing the PROCESS Button, this image will be taken as an input for the ML Model (which has already been trained) and the output will come out to be (given below)

Where we get the Plant, Disease, Cause and the Accuracy (Probability) with which the model has predicted that particular Disease .
